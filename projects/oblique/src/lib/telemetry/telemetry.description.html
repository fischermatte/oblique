<p>
	The Oblique front-end framework includes a telemetry feature that collects usage information. It's important that the Oblique team
	understands which modules are used so it can be decided on where to invest it's limited resources.
</p>
<p>
	The collected data are linked to the project name, version and homepage configured in the <code>package.json</code> file. Only the Oblique
	team and it's superiors have access to the collected data.
</p>

	<h3>When is data collected?</h3>
	<p>
		Data is collected in <strong>development</strong> mode only. That is if you build in angular production mode, telemetry is turned off.
	</p>
	<p>Ensure that you deploy only production builds of your Oblique project outside of your local development environment.</p>
	<pre>ng build --prod=true</pre>

	<h3>What is collected?</h3>
	<p>
		The telemetry records the usage on module basis. While loading one of the oblique modules, its usage is recorded. Additionally to this,
		your application name, version and homepage are also recorded.
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Oblique module names, the Oblique version and the theme used.</li>
		<li>Application name, version and homepage (from your <code>package.json</code>).</li>
	</ul>

	<h4>Selective module usage</h4>
	<p>
		Don't load ObliqueModule, as it loads all oblique modules. Instead carefully choose the modules that you need and only import those. As
		an added bonus you will have a smaller bundle because angular build will tree shake the unused modules for you ;-).
	</p>

	<h5>Do selectively load the needed modules</h5>
	<pre>
@NgModule({
	imports: [
		...
		ObSpinnerModule,
		ObMasterLayoutModule,
		ObNotificationModule,
		...
	]
})
	</pre
	>
	<h5>Don't load the ObliqueModule</h5>
	<pre>
@NgModule({
	imports: [
		...
		ObliqueModule
		...
	]
})
	</pre
	>
