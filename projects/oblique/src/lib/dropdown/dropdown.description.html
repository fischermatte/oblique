<p>
	This is a simple drowdown that will open a popover when toggled. The content panel can be opened left, right or in the middle of its
	toggle.
</p>
<p>
	This component has a special display when used as an header control on collapsed layout. Do not forget the
	<code>ob-control-icon</code> class on icon toggle for header control
</p>
<div class="ob-alert ob-alert-warning">
	<p>The toggle only works correctly when used with an icon and without text.</p>

	<p>Deprecated since version 7.1.0. Will be removed with the version 10.0.0. Use the Oblique popover instead.</p>
</div>
